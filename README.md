# GeNP@S$

This is a Python tool designed for the efficient and expeditious generation of robust, distinctive, and arbitrary passwords. The GeNP@S$ accommodates three password types: simple, complex, and base64 encoded. This versatile tool is well-suited for both personal and professional contexts.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

It is necessary to ensure that Python is installed on the machine. This can be confirmed by running the command below in the terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

If you don't have Python installed, download and install the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### How to run the program

Clone the repository or download the file directly to your system. To run the password generator, simply run the script:

```bash
python3 genpass.py
```

## Installation

To run the Password Generator, just make sure you have Python installed. You don't need any external dependencies to use the code, but it's important to make sure that the following modules are available:

- **random** (for generating random numbers)
- **base64** (for encryption)
- **pyfiglet** (for ASCII banner creation)

If you don't have `pyfiglet` installed, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
pip3 install pyfiglet
```
